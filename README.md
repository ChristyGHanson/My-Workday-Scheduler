# Christy's Work Day Scheduler

I am working on this simple calendar application titled "Christy's Work Day Scheduler." 

* It will allow a user to save events for each hour of the day after I further modify the starter code.
* This app is meant to run in the web browser.
* After more of my changes, it will feature more dynamic HTML and CSS that will be powered by jQuery.

### Current Updates
* The time and date in GMT are displayed at the bottom of the website using the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library which works specifically with date and time.

### 2/2/23 Submission Details
* Screenshot of the live page. ![Live Webpage Screenshot](Images\screenshot-live-browser.png)
